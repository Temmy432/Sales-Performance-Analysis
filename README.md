## RECOMMENDATIONS
â€¢ Mango Puree Sorbetto:  
Reposition the Mango Puree Sorbetto, which recorded no sales between 2016 and 2019, by targeting markets with higher purchase potential. Consider marketing this product in school environments, where there is a greater likelihood of engaging a youthful customer base interested in ice cream.

â€¢ Strengthen Key Customer Relationships:  
Focus on enhancing engagement with the largest customer segmentsâ€”primarily restaurants and hotelsâ€”by offering tailored promotions, loyalty programs, or bulk purchase discounts. Given that McDonald's (McD) is the top customer, strengthening this partnership should be a priority.

â€¢ Product Quantity and Brand Strategy:  
Since certain brands are achieving higher sales volumes but generating lower revenue, reassess pricing strategies to maximize profitability. Evaluate brands with lower sales to determine whether they should be repositioned, improved, or potentially discontinued.

â€¢ Optimize Pricing and Inventory Management:  
Utilize historical sales data to fine-tune pricing strategies, avoid overstocking of low-demand products, and ensure adequate supply of high-demand items.

â€¢ Target Market Expansion:  
Identify geographic areas and customer segments with growth potential and allocate resources accordingly to maximize market penetration and revenue growth.

â€¢ Revise Pricing and Discount Strategies:  
Reassess current pricing models, particularly in cases where increased sales volumes have not translated into proportional revenue growth. Implement targeted discounting or bundling strategies to improve margins while maintaining competitive pricing.

## CONCLUSION
In summary, the analysis of the sales data reveals several critical insights that inform the strategic direction of the company. While certain high-performing products and key customer segments are driving revenue, notable challenges include the decline in sales during specific periods and the underperformance of select product lines. These trends emphasize the need to optimize the product portfolio, revise pricing strategies, and strengthen strategic B2B partnerships.  
Additionally, Jakarta emerged as the top-performing location with a sales contribution of 458 million, significantly ahead of other regions. This highlights the geographical imbalance in sales performance and underscores the opportunity to replicate Jakartaâ€™s success model in underperforming areas.  
By focusing on targeted market expansion and leveraging data-driven sales forecasting, the company is well-positioned to address these challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Implementing the outlined recommendations will not only enhance operational efficiency but also support sustained growth and a stronger competitive market position.
